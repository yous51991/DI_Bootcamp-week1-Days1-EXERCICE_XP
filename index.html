                    from other felids and felines. They are often valued by humans for companionship. <br><br>

                    Present in Africa and India, the lion typically inhabits grasslands and savannahs, but is absent in
                    dense
                    forests. It is usually more diurnal than other big cats, but when persecuted adapts to being active
                    at night
                    and at twilight. A lion pride consists of a few adult males, related females and cubs. Prides vary
                    in size
                    and composition from three to 20 adult lions, depending on habitat and prey availability. Females
                    cooperate
                    when hunting and prey mostly on large ungulates, including antelope, deer, buffalo, zebra and even
                    giraffe
